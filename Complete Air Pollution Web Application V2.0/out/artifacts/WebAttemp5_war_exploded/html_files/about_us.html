            <p>Our goal is to create a better world for us to inhabit. For humanity to group together and act as one to save our planet from the pollution that we cause daily. We want to keep you informed about the quality of your air in a way that is easy

            <h2>Why Our Data is Reliable</h2>
            <p>Outdoor concentrations of pollutants are measured at more than 4000 monitoring stations owned and operated mainly by state environmental agencies. These agencies send hourly or daily measurements of pollutant concentrations to EPA's database
                called AQS (Air Quality System) where we gather up our information.</p>

            <h2>Why We Must Act Now</h2>
            <p>Short-lived climate pollutants are powerful climate forcers with global warming potentials many times that of carbon dioxide. They also significantly impact food, water and economic security for large populations throughout the world, both
                directly through their negative effects on public health, agriculture and ecosystems, and indirectly through their impact on the climate.</p>
            <p>The effects of short-lived climate pollutants represent a major development issue that calls for quick and significant global action. Measures to reduce short-lived climate pollutant emissions are often accessible and cost-effective, and if
                quickly implemented can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Avoid an estimated 2.4 million premature deaths from outdoor air pollution annually by 2030</li>
                <li>Prevent as much as 52 million tonnes of crop losses per year</li>
                <li>Slow the increase in global warming by as much as 0.6Â°C by 2050</li>
                <li>Prevent climate tipping points that can exacerbate long-term climate impacts and make adapting to climate change harder, especially for the poor and most vulnerable</li>
            </ul>
